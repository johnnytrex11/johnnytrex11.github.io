   <center> Nov 6 - Website/Portfolio Reflection </center>

â€œDescribe the incremental and iterative development process you used to develop your entire website, focusing on two distinct points in that process. Describe the difficulties and/or opportunities you encountered and how they were resolved or incorporated."
(Answer as if a graded Create Task Prompt.  Use full sentences, and answer all question parts.)
See Create Task Scoring Matrix Row 2 and 3
To create my website I started off by following the PLTW but then from there I really started to do my own thing. I started off by creating the layout and base for each tab. After I really just went through each tab adding the requirements with my own touch. This just allowed me to really do what I needed to create my website. Some problems I had were trying to format the text and having links open in a new tab. I resolved them by just looking at other coding to see the problem.

Which strategy for learning HTML, CSS and Java Script did you find the most helpful? (Strategies might include step-by-step lessons, trial and error, W3CSchool tutorials, searches, help from pair/classmate, etc.)
I found that trial and error was probably the most useful, It allowed my to struggle a bit but then learn from my mistakes. This showed me how to fix the problems and how to help other people if they had problems.

What are you most proud of?  
I am most proud of my About me page. I feel that I really put a lot of thought into it and really managed to put my own twist on it.
Did you meet all your goals from Oct 26?
Yes I feel that I did get it finished and did get it working really well.
