        <center> Hello, my name is Johnny Campbell, I am a junior at Coronado High School. I have been attending the Coronado School District ever since I moved here in second grade. I play beach and indoor volleyball, I have probably gotten ten blows in the past week, I am a great athlete, I enjoy playing golf, and eating lots of food such as sushi and drinking juice. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my friends and watching anime such as Naruto and One Piece. I plan on finishing my high school experience here at Coronado, and from there plan on attending a four year college somewhere in California to continue my education, which will later lead me on in life.
